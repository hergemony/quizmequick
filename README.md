**HELLO!**

Welcome to this week's challenge!

*QUIZ ME QUICK* üïõ üê∏ üíã

This is a quiz designed to test the user's ability to answer a set of question within a designated timeframe. To make the quiz more challenging, the user is penalised for incorrect responses by having time subtracted.

Questions are created by Hergemony‚Ñ¢ and are of a variety of topics. They are compiled with the help of the following source:

https://www.quizbreaker.com/trivia-questions

The quiz application uses HTML, CSS and Javascript. The use of Javascript is emphasised in providing quiz questions, collecting user data, determining whether answers match the correct answers, displaying answer to the user, generating scores, storing user initials and scores, appending a scoreboard at the end with option to return back to the beginning to recommence quiz.

FEATURES:
- Two HTML pages
index.html
highscores.html
- One CSS styles page
styles.css
- Two Javascript pages which contains variables including arrays with object, event listeners, if/else statements, for loops, functions, local storage using JSON parse and JSON stringify and sort function.

**Thanks for playing!**
