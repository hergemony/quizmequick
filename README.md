**QUIZ ME QUICK** üïõ üê∏ üíã

*HELLO!*

Welcome to this week's challenge!
This is a quiz designed to test the user's ability to answer a set of question within a designated timeframe. To make the quiz more challenging, the user is penalised for incorrect responses by having time subtracted.

Questions are created by Hergemony‚Ñ¢ and are of a variety of topics. They were compiled with the help of the following source:

https://www.quizbreaker.com/trivia-questions

The quiz application uses HTML, CSS and Javascript. The use of Javascript is emphasised in providing quiz questions, collecting user data, determining whether answers match the correct answers, displaying answer to the user, generating scores, storing user initials and scores, appending a scoreboard at the end with option to return back to the beginning and recommence quiz.

**SCREENSHOTS**

1) The user will see main page with instructions and a button to click in order to start the quiz.
